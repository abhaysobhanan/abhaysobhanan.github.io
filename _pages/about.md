<section class="about-intro">
  <p>
    I am an Assistant Professor in the Decision Sciences area at the
    <a href="https://www.iimb.ac.in">Indian Institute of Management Bangalore</a>.
    I completed my PhD in Industrial Engineering at the University of South Florida in July 2025,
    where I conducted my doctoral research under the guidance of
    Dr. <a href="http://www.eng.usf.edu/~hcharkhgard/">Hadi Gard</a> and
    Dr. <a href="https://www.chkwon.net">Changhyun Kwon</a>.
    My dissertation research focused on solving large‑scale vehicle routing problems by developing new methodologies and tackling real‑world issues such as equitable workload allocation. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Prior to my PhD, I served as a Research Associate at the Indian Institute of
    Management Ahmedabad. I hold a BS-MS dual degree in Mathematics from the
    National Institute of Technology Agartala (2019), where my master’s thesis
    explored Type-2 Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making.

## Research Directions

I am interested in applying operations research and machine learning to real-world optimization problems. My current research directions include:

- Optimization of transportation networks  
- Exact and heuristic optimization methods  
- Deep learning applications  
- Warehouse order-picking problems  
- Advancements in multi-objective optimization
