<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am a PhD Candidate in Industrial Engineering at the <a href="https://www.usf.edu">University of South Florida</a>, pursuing doctoral research under the guidance of Dr. <a href="http://www.eng.usf.edu/~hcharkhgard/">Hadi Gard</a> and Dr. <a href="https://www.chkwon.net">Changhyun Kwon</a>. My doctoral research focuses on optimizing large‑scale vehicle‑routing problems by developing new methodologies and tackling real‑world issues such as equitable workload allocation.

<br>
<br>

Before joining USF, I worked as a Research Associate at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, India. I earned a BS‑MS dual degree in Mathematics from the National Institute of Technology Agartala in 2019, where my master’s thesis explored Type‑2 Fuzzy Multi‑Criteria Decision Making.
