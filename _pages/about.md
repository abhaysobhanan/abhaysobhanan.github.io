<p align="justify">
I am a PhD Candidate in Industrial Engineering at the [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu){:target="_blank"}, working under the guidance of Dr. [Hadi Gard](http://www.eng.usf.edu/~hcharkhgard/){:target="_blank"} and Dr. [Changhyun Kwon](https://www.chkwon.net){:target="_blank"}. My doctoral research centers on optimizing large‑scale vehicle‑routing problems, developing new methodologies, and tackling real‑world issues such as equitable workload allocation.
