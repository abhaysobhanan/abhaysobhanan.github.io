- [INFORMS](https://www.informs.org) is the largest international association for researchers and professionals in OR and related fields, and offers conferences, networking opportunities, news, job postings, resources and publications. 

- [Subject to](www.youtube.com/@Subjectto_){:target="_blank"} is a series of conversations with prominent researchers in Operations Research/Management, hosted by [Anand Subramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/anand-subramanian/).

- [Julia Programming for Operations Research](https://www.chkwon.net/julia/) by [Changhyun Kwon](https://www.chkwon.net) offers introductory programming tutorials alongside simple examples to solve popular optimization methods and problems.

- Some of the popular tools that could help you solve your optimization problems:
  - Commercial solvers: CPLEX, Gurobi Optimizer
  - Open-source solvers: SCIP (for MIP, MINLP), GLPK (widely used), Google's OR Tools, VROOM (for vehicle routing problems)
  
- [VeRoViz](https://veroviz.org) is an open-source package for visualization and data generation of vehicle routing problems.

## General

- [The importance of stupidity in scientific research](https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.033340){:target="_blank"} by Martin A. Schwartz is an interesting read for researchers pondering unanswered questions in their field. 

- [Why You Should De-Optimize Your Life](https://youtu.be/cqdm9z3oF0c): Maria Cano talks about the role of occassional de-optimization in long-term productivity.


## PhD Students

- LaTeX is a highly recommended writing tool if your research is in mathematics, engineering or related fields. Beginners may refer to [this](https://stom.chkwon.net/latex/) tutorial.

- Git: If you code often (or plan to), learn about this version control system. See [this](https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp) tutorial for details. 

- [SEDAC Population Estimation Service](https://beta.sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4/population-estimation-service) is a web-based service for estimating population statistics within a user defined area. 

- [A Happy PhD](https://ahappyphd.org){:target="_blank"} is a blog about doctoral productivity, supervision and wellbeing.

- [Scriptoria](https://www.scriptoria.org/en/){:target="_blank"} is a blog with a collection of articles designed to guide PhD students in writing their scientific articles.

- [Generate font pairings](https://fontjoy.com) that works well for your presentation slides.
